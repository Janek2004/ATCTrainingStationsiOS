To Consider:

What happens if user goes away from the 
    patient/station
    
    - It needs to be indicated somehow
    
    Welcome Message
        
    
    Goodbye Message

    Choosing Station will result in starting ranging only beacon associated with the station.
    
    

    We will be caching content to prevent overload of the system. Content will be refreshed every 5 minutes??

    Or just based on content id?
